    "risk_reason": "REASONING: - **APY/APR Metrics:** The latest Total APY of 943.48% is extremely high and potentially unsustainable, especially since it's not backed by a similarly high Farm APR (235.27%). The absence of 24h and weekly APY/APR data makes it difficult to assess volatility, but the high APY alone raises concerns about its sustainability. - **VS HODL Performance:** The vault's performance against holding is highly volatile. The 24h performance shows significant gains (+87.26%), but the weekly and 57-day performances indicate substantial losses (-345.23% and -23.18% respectively). This volatility is further highlighted by extreme swings in performance against wS and SACRA, with SACRA showing a dramatic 57-day loss of -193.92%. - **Price Stability:** The vault's price has depreciated significantly over 57 days (-45.28%), which is well beyond the threshold for high risk. While wS shows a moderate depreciation (-29.59%), SACRA's price increase (+148.64%) does not mitigate the vault's own price risk. The price movements suggest high exposure to market volatility and potential for impermanent loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential Losses:** The combination of high APY, extreme volatility in VS HODL performance, and significant price depreciation over 57 days indicates a high level of risk. The vault's strategy appears to be highly leveraged or speculative, leading to substantial potential losses. Key risks: Unsustainable APY, extreme volatility in performance metrics, significant price depreciation, and high potential for losses.",

    "risk_reason": "REASONING: - **APY/APR Metrics**: The latest Total APY of 11.28% and Total APR of 10.69% are reasonable and within sustainable ranges. The Farm APR matches the Total APR, suggesting a straightforward yield mechanism without excessive leverage or complex derivatives. There is no data provided on historical volatility of these rates, but the current figures do not indicate unsustainable yields. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault shows positive returns compared to holding the underlying assets over different time frames. The 24-hour performance ranges from +5.55% to +7.23%, the weekly performance from +24.38% to +26.19%, and the 57-day performance from +4.09% to +4.2%. This indicates consistent outperformance across short and long terms, though the 57-day performance is relatively low. - **Price Stability**: Over the 57-day period, the vault's price has depreciated by -27.99%, which is within the medium risk range (-30% to +30%). The underlying assets, atETH and scETH, have experienced slightly higher depreciation at -32.19% and -32.08% respectively. This suggests moderate price stability and a potential for impermanent loss, but the vault's depreciation is less severe than the underlying assets. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault's performance metrics show moderate volatility in returns and price changes. The vault's price depreciation is significant but not extreme, and the consistent outperformance against holding the underlying assets suggests a degree of stability in generating returns. Key risks: - Moderate price depreciation over 57 days indicates potential for losses. - The vault's returns, while positive, show variability over different time frames, suggesting some level of performance risk. - The sustainability of the current APY/APR levels cannot be fully assessed without historical data, posing a risk if these rates were to decline.",

There is no data provided on 24h or weekly rates, so we cannot assess volatility in these metrics, but the current rates do not suggest unsustainable yields. - **VS HOLD Performance**: The vault's performance compared to holding the underlying assets shows significant short-term volatility, with a 24-hour drop of -50.98% against HODL, -126.19% against wS HODL, and -6.56% against OS HODL. However, over a longer period (57 days), the vault slightly outperforms holding, with gains of +2.06%, +1.81%, and +2.2% respectively. This indicates that while the vault may experience high short-term volatility, it can still provide positive returns over a longer timeframe. - **Price Stability**: Over the 57-day period, the vault's price has decreased by -13.35%, which is within a reasonable range of price stability. The prices of wS and OS have also decreased by -15.19% and -15.57% respectively, suggesting a moderate level of price correlation between the tokens. The vault's performance is slightly better than the underlying assets, indicating some resilience against price depreciation. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault shows significant short-term volatility, particularly in the 24-hour performance metrics. However, it manages to provide positive returns over a longer period, which mitigates some of the risk. The price changes over 57 days are moderate, suggesting a medium level of exposure to market movements.

The Farm APR matches the Total APR, suggesting that the yield is primarily derived from farming activities. There is no extreme volatility in APY/APR as the rates are consistent and below the 1000% threshold that would flag as unsustainable. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault shows significant short-term volatility with a 24-hour performance of -17.76% to -18.29% across different HODL metrics, but a substantial weekly increase of around +627%. Over the longer term (57 days), the performance stabilizes at around +2.48% to +2.5%, indicating a return to near baseline after significant fluctuations. This suggests a high degree of short-term volatility but a more stable long-term performance. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price has decreased by -8.52%, which is within the acceptable range of -10% to +10% for low risk. The tokens wS and OS have experienced slightly higher depreciation at -10.99% and -11.04% respectively, but all are still within a moderate range. The price changes do not suggest extreme volatility or significant risk of impermanent loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault demonstrates moderate volatility, particularly in the short term, as evidenced by the significant swings in 24-hour and weekly VS HODL performance. However, the longer-term performance and price stability suggest a more controlled risk environment. Key risks: The vault is subject to high short-term volatility, as indicated by the 24-hour and weekly VS HODL performance, which could lead to significant short-term losses. However, the longer-term stability and moderate price changes suggest a medium risk profile overall.",

The farm APR matches the total APR, suggesting that the yield is primarily driven by farming activities. Such high yields without clear backing are flagged as unsustainable. - **VS HODL Performance:** The vault's performance against holding different assets shows extreme volatility. The 24-hour performance ranges from -175.42% to +685.91%, and the weekly performance shows even more significant swings, from -1007.25% to +383.33%. Over 57 days, the performance is positive but varies widely from +12.91% to +26.24%. This indicates high inconsistency and risk. - **Price Stability:** The vault's price has only depreciated by -2.84% over 57 days, which is relatively stable. However, the assets wS and SWPx have seen significant depreciation of -29.08% and -15.75% respectively, indicating potential for impermanent loss if these assets are part of the vault's strategy. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses:** The vault exhibits extreme volatility in its performance metrics, with significant swings in both short-term and long-term performance against holding. The high APY/APR suggests potential for high returns but also high risk of loss due to the unsustainability of such yields. Key risks: High volatility in returns, potential for significant losses due to unsustainable yield rates, and exposure to assets with notable price depreciation.",

The farm APR matches the total APR, indicating a straightforward yield source without additional complexities. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault consistently outperforms holding the underlying assets over various time frames. The 24h performance shows a +3.63% increase compared to HODL, while the 57-day performance is at +3.69%. This indicates stability and reliability in outperforming direct holding, both in the short and long term. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price increased by +3.69%, which is stable and positive. USDC and scUSD have minimal price changes, suggesting low volatility in the underlying assets. The vault's performance aligns closely with the price stability of these assets, indicating low risk of impermanent loss or significant price depreciation. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault shows low volatility across all metrics, with consistent performance and minimal risk of significant losses. The price movement patterns are stable, and the vault's returns are reliable over different time frames. Key risks: The primary risk appears to be minimal, given the stable APY, consistent outperformance against holding, and low price volatility.

This high yield volatility raises concerns about the sustainability of the strategy. - **Price Stability**: Over the last 57 days, the vault experienced a significant price depreciation of -36.07%, which falls into the high-risk category. The tokens wS and TAILS also saw substantial declines of -35.04% and -53.80% respectively, indicating a high risk of impermanent loss and overall price instability. - **VS HOLD Performance**: The vault's performance against holding varies widely across different time frames. It shows a strong short-term performance (24h +210.1% vs HODL) but a much weaker long-term performance (57d +6.72% vs HODL). The performance against wS and TAILS also fluctuates dramatically, with wS showing a significant negative return over the week (-423.3%). This inconsistency and volatility in performance against holding suggest high risk. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The combination of extreme APY/APR volatility, significant price depreciation, and inconsistent VS HOLD performance points to a highly volatile and risky strategy. The potential for losses is high, given the unsustainable yields and substantial price drops.

Against BRUSH, the performance is highly inconsistent, ranging from +32.55% in 24h to -17.94% over a week and -0.43% over 57 days.

These significant price drops indicate high risk and potential for losses, as all assets have depreciated considerably. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The combination of high price depreciation, significant volatility in VS HODL performance, and the lack of historical APY/APR data to assess yield sustainability contribute to an overall high risk profile. The vault's price has fallen more than 30% in 57 days, which is a strong indicator of potential for losses.

Key risks: - Short-term volatility in VS HOLD performance could lead to significant losses. - The underlying assets (wS and sDOG) have experienced significant depreciation, which could impact the vault's stability if the trend continues. - The lack of historical APY/APR data makes it difficult to fully assess the sustainability and volatility of yields.",

However, the absence of historical data to compare with the latest figures makes it difficult to assess volatility and sustainability accurately. The Farm APR matches the Total APR, indicating that the yield is solely from farming activities without additional pool fees, which adds to the risk if the farm's performance is volatile. \u2022 VS HODL Performance: The vault shows extreme volatility in performance against different HODL benchmarks. The 24h and weekly returns show significant swings (e.g., +47.39% to +58.48% in 24h and week for VAULT VS HODL, and -299.88% in a week for VAULT VS wS HODL), indicating high risk. The 57-day performance is positive but low compared to short-term volatility, suggesting inconsistent long-term outperformance. \u2022 Price Stability: Over the 57-day period, the vault and associated tokens (wS and MOON) have experienced significant price depreciation (-39.05%, -42.83%, and -48.27% respectively). This level of price drop indicates high risk due to potential impermanent loss and overall market downturn. \u2022 Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses: The combination of high APY/APR, extreme short-term volatility in VS HODL performance, and significant price depreciation over 57 days points to a high risk of losses. The vault's performance suggests it is highly sensitive to market movements and may not provide stable returns over time. Key risks: High volatility in short-term performance, significant price depreciation, potential for impermanent loss, and reliance on farming yields without diversification.",

Against HODL, the vault shows a 24h gain of +0.15%, a weekly gain of +15.14%, and a 57-day gain of +0.29%, indicating inconsistent performance over different time frames. Against wS, the vault shows a drastic 24h loss of -41%, a significant weekly gain of +133.67%, and a slight 57-day loss of -1.16%, highlighting extreme short-term volatility. Against DONKS, the vault shows a 24h gain of +40.7%, a large weekly loss of -125.8%, and a 57-day gain of +1.82%, further demonstrating high volatility and inconsistent performance. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price has depreciated by -24.45%, which is significant but within a moderate range. The prices of wS and DONKS have also depreciated by -23.29% and -26.27% respectively, showing a degree of correlation in price movement among the assets. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault exhibits high volatility in its performance against holding different assets, particularly in the short term. The price depreciation over 57 days is notable but not extreme. The absence of yield adds to the uncertainty about the strategy's effectiveness. Key risks: The strategy shows no current yield, significant short-term volatility in performance against holding different assets, and moderate price depreciation over 57 days. This suggests a medium risk level due to the lack of yield and the inconsistent performance across different time frames.",

The farm APR matches the total APR, indicating no additional yield from other sources. There is no data to assess volatility over time, but the current figures do not suggest extreme unsustainability. \u2022 VS HODL Performance: The vault shows significant short-term outperformance against holding (24h +35.83%, Week +35.3%) but a more modest long-term gain (57d +3.64%). This indicates variability in performance, with strong short-term gains but less consistent long-term results. The performance against wS and ECO shows mixed results, with ECO showing the highest short-term gains but similar long-term gains to wS. \u2022 Price Stability: Over the last 57 days, the vault's price has decreased by -30.65%, which is at the threshold of significant depreciation. The tokens wS and ECO have experienced even greater depreciation (-33.66% and -34.94% respectively), suggesting a general market downturn rather than vault-specific issues. This level of price movement indicates moderate risk. \u2022 Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses: The vault's performance shows variability, particularly in short-term gains, but the long-term performance is more subdued. The price depreciation is notable but not extreme, and the APY/APR figures suggest a moderate yield potential without extreme volatility. Key risks: Moderate price depreciation over 57 days, variable short-term vs long-term performance, and potential for market-dependent yields.",

Over 24 hours, the vault is down 18.07% against holding, and over 57 days, it's down 4.62%. Against USDC, the performance is drastically worse, with a 57-day loss of 43.8%. Even against stS, the long-term performance is nearly flat at -0.31%. This indicates high volatility and inconsistent performance. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price has dropped by 43.79%, which is a significant depreciation. The stS token has a similar depreciation of 43.48%, suggesting a high correlation and potential for impermanent loss if involved in liquidity pools. USDC remains stable, highlighting the vault's underperformance. - **Overall Volatility and Loss Potential**: The combination of high APY/APR, significant underperformance against holding, and substantial price depreciation over 57 days indicates high volatility and a high potential for losses.

The long-term performance (57 days) shows modest gains against HODL (+2.12%) and MOON (+6.14%) but a slight loss against wS (-1.37%). This indicates inconsistent performance and high volatility. - **Price Stability:** Over 57 days, the vault's price has depreciated significantly by -40.07%, which is higher than the recommended threshold for high risk (>30%). The tokens wS and MOON have also experienced substantial depreciation (-38.70% and -46.20% respectively), suggesting a correlated decline in value which increases the risk of impermanent loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential Losses:** The combination of high APY/APR, significant price depreciation, and extreme volatility in VS HODL performance against different assets points to a high-risk strategy. The potential for substantial losses, as evidenced by the price drops and inconsistent performance, underscores the risk level. Key risks: Significant price depreciation, high volatility in performance against HODL, potential for impermanent loss due to correlated price drops among assets.",

Key risks: - No current yield, indicating potential operational issues or strategy halt. - Extreme volatility in performance against different assets, suggesting high risk and unpredictability. - Significant long-term losses despite short-term gains, indicating potential for substantial capital depreciation.",

Against stS HODL, it shows extremely high returns across all periods.

The high APY/APR, extreme price changes, and highly variable VS HOLD performance suggest a high risk of rapid value fluctuations and potential losses.

The difference in depreciation rates (-22.24% vs -13.48%) suggests a potential for increased impermanent loss or other adverse price movements affecting the vault. \u2022 Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses: The combination of zero current yield, extreme short-term gains followed by long-term losses, and significant price depreciation points to a highly volatile and risky strategy. The potential for losses is high, especially given the current lack of yield generation. Key risks: Extreme volatility in short-term vs long-term performance, significant price depreciation, and current lack of yield generation indicate a high risk of loss and instability in the strategy.",

Against sDOG HODL, there's high short-term gain (+27.32%) but a significant loss over the week (-632.85%) and moderate gain over 57 days (+7.38%).

The lack of yield from APY/APR suggests no income generation, which could be a concern if the vault relies on such income for stability or returns.

This indicates no current yield, which could be a sign of a paused or non-functional vault. The lack of yield raises concerns about the sustainability and viability of the strategy. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault's performance against holding various assets shows extreme volatility. The 24-hour performance is drastically negative across all metrics (ranging from -355.08% to -431.74%), and the weekly performance is even more severe (-1276.91% to -1925.19%). Even over the longer term (57 days), the performance remains significantly negative (-44.18% to -57.4%). This indicates high risk and instability compared to holding the underlying assets. - **Price Stability**: Over the 57-day period, the vault's price has decreased by -9.97%, which is within a reasonable range. However, the wS token has seen a significant increase of +47.44%, indicating a high degree of price divergence. This suggests potential impermanent loss risk, particularly in relation to wS. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault exhibits extreme volatility in its performance metrics, with significant negative returns across different time frames. The lack of any APY/APR further exacerbates the risk profile, as there is no yield to offset potential losses. Key risks: Extreme volatility in VS HODL performance, no current yield, potential impermanent loss due to significant price divergence between vault and wS token.",

The Farm APR matches the Total APR, indicating all yield comes from farming, which could be risky if dependent on volatile incentives. - **Price Stability:** Over 57 days, the vault experienced a significant price depreciation of -44.51%. This is coupled with similar depreciations in related tokens wS (-39.75%) and TYSG (-71.76%), indicating a high risk of impermanent loss and general market downturn affecting the vault's value. - **VS HODL Performance:** The vault shows extreme short-term outperformance against HODL with 24h gains of +96.06% and weekly gains of +865.39%, but a modest long-term performance of +5.38% over 57 days. This indicates high volatility and potential for significant fluctuations. The performance against wS and TYSG also shows similar patterns of high short-term gains but negative or lower long-term returns, highlighting inconsistent outperformance. - **Overall Volatility and Loss Potential:** The combination of high APY/APR, significant price depreciation, and extreme short-term VS HODL performance with poor long-term results suggests high risk. The vault's value has dropped considerably, and the high yields may not compensate for the potential losses.

This indicates high volatility and inconsistency in outperforming holding, with significant short-term gains that do not translate into long-term stability. - **Price Stability**: The vault's price has depreciated by -24.91% over 57 days, which is significant and indicates potential for losses. The associated tokens wS and ECO have depreciated even more at -33.94% and -34.55% respectively, suggesting a high correlation and increased risk of impermanent loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The extreme short-term gains contrasted with the significant price depreciation over 57 days point to high volatility and potential for substantial losses. The vault's performance against holding is highly variable, suggesting it might not reliably outperform holding over time. Key risks: High APY volatility, potential for unsustainable yields, significant price depreciation, and extreme short-term performance variability.",

    "risk_reason": "REASONING: - **APY/APR Metrics**: The latest Total APY of 8.01% and Total APR of 7.71% are relatively stable, with no significant volatility or extreme values. The Farm APR matches the Total APR, suggesting a straightforward yield mechanism. However, the sustainability of these rates cannot be fully assessed without historical data, but they appear reasonable and not flagged for unsustainability. - **VS HOLD Performance**: The vault's performance compared to holding the underlying assets shows extreme volatility. Over 24 hours, the vault underperformed by -40.52% against HODL, and over a week, it was -59.25%. Even over 57 days, the performance was marginally negative at -1.67%. The comparison to USDC HODL shows even more drastic underperformance (-526.02% over 24h, -1192.65% over a week, -22.13% over 57 days), indicating significant risk. Conversely, against stS HODL, the vault shows positive but highly volatile performance (+243.16% over 24h, +512.87% over a week, +11.52% over 57 days). This extreme variability in performance suggests high risk and inconsistency. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price decreased by -22.13%, indicating significant depreciation. USDC remained stable with a +0.01% change, while stS depreciated by -33.64%. The vault's price movement is within a high-risk range (>20% depreciation), suggesting potential for significant losses. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The combination of high volatility in VS HOLD performance and significant price depreciation over 57 days points to a high level of risk. The vault's performance is inconsistent and shows potential for substantial losses, especially in short-term periods. Key risks: High volatility in VS HOLD performance, significant price depreciation over 57 days, and potential for substantial losses in short-term periods.",

This indicates a consistent yield source without extreme volatility. However, the APY is below the threshold for unsustainable yields, suggesting a sustainable yield rate. - **VS HOLD Performance**: The vault's performance compared to holding the underlying assets shows extreme volatility. Against HODL, the vault underperforms significantly over short periods (24h: -84.14%, Week: -135.75%) but shows a moderate underperformance over 57 days (-4.64%). Against scUSD, the underperformance is even more pronounced (24h: -586.19%, Week: -1361.83%, 57d: -29.64%). Conversely, against stS, the vault outperforms significantly in the short term (24h: +278.3%, Week: +581.6%) but only moderately over 57 days (+14.66%). This indicates highly inconsistent performance and significant risk. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price has decreased by -29.64%, which is a significant depreciation. The scUSD price remains stable at 0.00%, while stS has depreciated by -44.30%. The vault's price movement aligns more closely with stS, suggesting a potential correlation that could amplify losses if stS continues to depreciate. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault exhibits high volatility in its performance against different HODL scenarios and significant price depreciation over 57 days. The extreme swings in short-term performance (both positive and negative) against different assets indicate a high level of risk and potential for significant losses. Key risks: High volatility in short-term performance, significant price depreciation, and inconsistent outperformance against different assets.",

The tokens wS and stS have experienced slightly higher depreciation at -32.87% and -32.43% respectively, suggesting a moderate correlation in price movements. The risk of impermanent loss is present due to the price depreciation. - **VS HOLD Performance:** The vault's performance compared to holding the underlying assets shows significant variability.

However, over the longer term (57 days), the vault has consistently outperformed holding, with gains ranging from +4.15% to +4.59%. This suggests a mixed performance with potential for both short-term losses and long-term gains. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses:** The vault exhibits moderate volatility in both APY/APR and price movements.

This indicates very low volatility and a stable yield, well within the sustainable range and far below the threshold for flagging unsustainable yields. \u2022 **VS HODL Performance:** The vault shows consistent performance against holding various assets. Over 24 hours, the vault outperforms holding by +1.02% against HODL, +0.03% against USDC, and +1.96% against scUSD. Over a week, the performance remains positive against HODL (+0.43%) and scUSD (+1.06%), though it slightly underperforms against USDC (-0.24%). Over 57 days, the vault consistently outperforms all three benchmarks, with gains of +0.46% against HODL, +0.49% against USDC, and +0.44% against scUSD. This indicates a stable and reliable outperformance. \u2022 **Price Stability:** Over 57 days, the vault's price has increased by +0.50%, while USDC and scUSD have seen minimal changes (+0.01% and +0.06% respectively). This suggests strong price stability and minimal risk of impermanent loss or significant depreciation. \u2022 **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses:** The vault exhibits low volatility in both its yield and price performance. The consistent positive returns against various benchmarks and the stable price changes indicate a low risk of significant losses. Key risks: The primary risk appears to be the low yield, which may not be attractive to investors seeking higher returns, but this does not increase the risk level of the vault itself.",

However, the lack of historical data to compare the latest rates against 24h and weekly rates makes it impossible to assess volatility directly. The low yield suggests a potentially sustainable rate, but without more data, we cannot confirm this fully. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault shows varied performance against different HODL metrics. Against HODL, it has a 24h gain of +3.69%, a weekly gain of +0.65%, and a 57-day gain of +0.4%. Against wS HODL, it shows a 24h gain of +9.54%, a weekly loss of -5.93%, and a 57-day gain of +0.63%. Against stS HODL, it has a 24h loss of -1.58%, a weekly gain of +6.52%, and a 57-day gain of +0.19%. The performance is inconsistent across different time frames and against different assets, indicating high volatility and unpredictability. - **Price Stability**: Over the last 57 days, the vault's price has dropped by -48.66%, wS by -49.29%, and stS by -48.85%. This indicates significant price depreciation across all assets involved, suggesting high risk of loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The significant price depreciation and the inconsistent VS HODL performance highlight a high level of volatility and potential for substantial losses. The stable but low APY/APR cannot offset the high risk indicated by the price drops and performance inconsistency. Key risks: High price depreciation, inconsistent VS HODL performance, and potential for significant losses despite a seemingly sustainable yield rate.",

    "risk_reason": "REASONING: - **APY/APR Metrics:** The Latest Total APY of 9,564.63% and Latest Total APR of 459.98% are extremely high and unsustainable. Such high yields, especially when exceeding 1000%, are often indicative of high risk and potential for significant volatility. The Farm APR matches the Total APR, suggesting that the yield is entirely dependent on the farm's performance, which adds to the risk if the farm's conditions change. - **Price Stability:** Over 57 days, the vault's price has decreased by 16.16%, which is within a moderate range. However, the tokens wS and SACRA show significant volatility, with wS dropping by 34.49% and SACRA increasing by 133.39%. This indicates high volatility and potential for impermanent loss, especially given the large price movements in the underlying assets. - **VS HOLD Performance:** The vault's performance compared to holding the assets directly shows extreme volatility. In the short term (24h and Week), the vault significantly outperforms holding, with gains of +1308.02% and +880.75% respectively. However, over the longer term (57 days), the vault underperforms by -139.42%. This indicates a high risk of significant losses over time despite short-term gains. The same pattern is observed with wS and SACRA, showing +18.11% and -149.77% over 57 days, respectively, further highlighting the volatility and risk. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses:** The combination of extreme APY/APR volatility, significant price movements in the underlying assets, and highly variable VS HOLD performance over different time frames points to a high risk of losses. The vault's strategy appears to be highly leveraged or dependent on complex mechanisms to achieve such high short-term gains, which increases the risk of significant downturns. Key risks: Extreme yield volatility, potential for significant losses over time, high dependency on farm performance, and exposure to highly volatile underlying assets.",

The absence of any yield is highly concerning as it indicates no return on investment, which is unsustainable for a vault strategy. - **VS HODL Performance**: The vault's performance compared to holding other assets is extremely volatile. The 24-hour and weekly performance against HODL is significantly negative (-519.34% and -213.87% respectively), indicating high short-term risk. Even though the 57-day performance shows a positive return (+14.45%), the extreme swings suggest high instability. The performance against USDC and SWPx also shows dramatic short-term volatility, with 24-hour changes of -1465.02% and +1512.49% respectively, further highlighting the risk. - **Price Stability**: Over 57 days, the vault's price has increased by +16.08%, which is relatively stable compared to the drastic short-term performance changes. USDC and SWPx show minimal price changes (-0.02% and +5.71% respectively), indicating that the vault's price movement is not highly correlated with these assets. However, the significant short-term volatility suggests a high risk of impermanent loss. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The vault exhibits extreme volatility in its short-term performance metrics, with significant negative returns over 24 hours and a week, despite a positive long-term return. This indicates a high risk of losses due to the unpredictability of the vault's performance. Key risks: The vault's lack of any yield, extreme short-term volatility, and potential for significant losses make it a high-risk strategy. The absence of sustainable income and the dramatic swings in performance against holding other assets highlight the instability and risk associated with this vault.",

    "risk_reason": "REASONING: - **APY/APR Metrics**: The latest Total APY and APR are both at 0%, indicating no current yield from the vault. The Farm APR is also 0%, which suggests that there is no income being generated from farming activities. This lack of yield raises concerns about the sustainability of the vault's strategy, as there is no visible source of income. - **Price Stability**: Over the 57-day period, the vault's price has depreciated significantly by -50.04%. This is a stark contrast to the more stable price changes of wS (-3.66%) and WETH (-27.24%). The large price drop in the vault indicates high volatility and potential for significant losses. - **VS HOLD Performance**: The vault's performance compared to holding assets directly shows extreme volatility. The 24-hour performance varies widely (+42.09% vs wS, -69.15% vs wS HODL, +160.74% vs WETH HODL), and the longer-term performance over the week and 57 days is equally erratic (-636.56% vs wS, +299.68% vs wS HODL, -2195.38% vs WETH HODL, -35.83% vs wS, -46.38% vs wS HODL, -22.79% vs WETH HODL). This indicates a lack of consistency and high risk of significant losses. - **Overall Volatility and Potential for Losses**: The combination of no yield, significant price depreciation, and extreme volatility in VS HOLD performance points to a high-risk strategy. The vault's value has dropped by half over 57 days, and the performance metrics suggest a high potential for losses. Key risks: - Lack of yield generation, indicating potential for strategy failure. - Significant price depreciation, increasing the risk of capital loss. - Extreme volatility in performance relative to holding assets, indicating high risk and unpredictability.",

This indicates high risk due to inconsistent and volatile returns compared to holding the underlying assets directly. \u2022 Price changes over 57 days show significant depreciation for both the Vault (-21.31%) and wS (-39.95%), while USDC remains stable (-0.09%). The substantial price drops for Vault and wS indicate potential for significant losses. \u2022 Overall, the combination of stable but low APY/APR, extreme VS HODL performance volatility, and significant price depreciation over 57 days suggests a high-risk strategy.
